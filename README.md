*This repo is mainly going to be some scenarios in quantum physics that I find fascinating*

infinite_potential_well.py is a program for the infinite potential well problem in quantum physics. Although this might be a really simple problem
it can form the basis for understanding a lot of quantum phenomena.

finite_potential_well.py is a program for the more realistic case of a finite potential well which has practical applications in nanostructures and 
devices like the quantum well laser

quantum_harmonic_oscillator.py is a program for the case of a harmonic oscillator. This problem has an exact analytical solution, albeit quite lengthy.
This simple oscillator model has applications in many cases like lattice vibrations and molecular vibrations 

finite_potential_barrier.py is a program to simulate an electron striking a potential barrier. The particle is initialised in free space and goes on
to strike a potential barrier (the potential energy of the barrier is higher than the energy of the particle). Part of the wave manages to tunnel through the barrier 
while the rest is reflected. In this scenario, we solve the time dependent Schrodinger equation while appropriately defining the potentials
